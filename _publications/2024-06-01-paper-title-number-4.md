Even for a conservative estimate, 80% of enterprise data reside in unstructured files, stored in data lakes that
accommodate heterogeneous formats. Classical search engines can no longer meet information seeking needs, especially
when the task is to browse and explore for insight formulation. In other words, there are no obvious search keywords to
use. Knowledge graphs, due to their natural visual appeals that reduce the human cognitive load, become the winning
candidate for heterogeneous data integration and knowledge representation.
In this paper, we introduce Docs2KG, a novel framework designed to extract multimodal information from diverse and
heterogeneous unstructured documents, including emails, web pages, PDF files, and Excel files. Dynamically generates a
unified knowledge graph that represents the extracted key information, Docs2KG enables efficient querying and
exploration of document data lakes. Unlike existing approaches that focus on domain-specific data sources or
pre-designed schemas, Docs2KG offers a flexible and extensible solution that can adapt to various document structures
and content types. The proposed framework unifies data processing supporting a multitude of downstream tasks with
improved domain interpretability. Docs2KG is publicly accessible at this https URL, and a demonstration video is
